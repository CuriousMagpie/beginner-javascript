**Lesson 04: Variables and Statements**
differences between variables:

var and let can be changed within the code, like:
  first = 'hello';
  age = 25;

const cannot be changed at all, so:
  cool = false;
will not work!

var variables are scoped differently than let and const variables.
var is a function scoped variable
let and const are block scoped variables ie {}

use const by default and let when needed

camelCase
  const iLikePizze = true;
UpperCamelCase
  const ILikeHotDogs = false;
snake_case
  const this_is_snake_case = 'hiss!';
kebab-case
  const this-is-not-allowed-in-javascript = true;
